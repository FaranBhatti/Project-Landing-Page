# 🏠 Project-Landing-Page
Landing page project in order to practice building a website. 

In terms of what the theme is: I personally enjoy working out. I figured it would be cool that I made something that resembles something I'm passionate about so this is more of like a call to action landing page for a community of lifters.	😄
